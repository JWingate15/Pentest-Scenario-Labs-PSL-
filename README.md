# Pentest-Scenario-Labs-PSL-
The PSL is a simulated black-box penetration testing environment for students in the Cybersecurity Professional Penetration Tester program at Divergence Academy. During this week-long training scenario, I served as the team led for a group of four students on team Delta, or Digital Environment Leveraging Tactical Analysis. Our team was able to gain access to 11/12 machines in the PSL environment and capture 17 total flags yielding 425 points out of a possible 540. 

We started the engagement by conducting a Network Mapper (Nmap) scan on the internal LAN to determine our first target.

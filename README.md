# Pentest Scenario Labs (PSL)
The PSL is a simulated black-box penetration testing environment for students in the Cybersecurity Professional Penetration Tester (CPPT) program at Divergence Academy. During this week-long training scenario, I served as the team lead for a group of four students on team Delta, or Digital Environment Leveraging Tactical Analysis. Our team was able to gain access to 11/12 machines in the PSL environment and captured 17 total flags yielding 425 points out of a possible 540. 

An in-depth write-up of the PSL engagement can be found in the files for Pentest Scenario Labs, labeled as Delta Pentest Report Final.pdf 

During this simulated engagement, I learned and used the following applications and services: 

1) Burp Suite for automated web application fuzzing 

2) Ran screen sessions in my Kali Linux attacker box to establish continuity and organization of my work 

3) Utilized xargs (extended arguments) for automation and data manipulation

4) Ran John the Ripper and Hydra utilizing several password wordlists (fasttrack.txt, milw0rm-dictionary.txt, rockyou.txt, 1000-most-common-passwords.txt, and 10k-most-common.txt, ) and rule sets (JumboSingle and OneRuleToRuleThemAll) to brute-force retrieved hashed passwords from engagement 

5) SQLmap to automate SQL query injections and enumerate backend database

6) Revshells.com to create reverse shells for command injection and establishing persistence on the system

7) Linux Nano file creator to create scope files, store discovered usernames/passwords, and store a reverse shell on a target machine that allowed our team to achieve persistence which inevitably allowed us to pivot to different targets on the internal network

8) Establish a secure shell (SSH) connection on a target machine we achieved root access on to pivot throughout the rest of the internal network 

9) Set up port forwarding rules to use specific ports on the attacker boxes' internal wide area network (WAN) to allow us to catch a reverse shell with netcat, establish persistence, and utilize SOCKS5 proxy to establish a tunnel between our attacker boxes and a target machine (App1), allowing for our team to pivot throughout the internal network

10) Network Mapper (Nmap) to conduct fast scans and service scans of each of the target IP addresses

11) Simple python server to download an exploit from my Kali Linux attacker box to the temporary folder in a target machine to avoid EDR detection 

12) MSFconsole to search and run exploits against target machines

13) Searchsploit to search for exploits against target machines not included in MSFconsole

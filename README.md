# Pentest Scenario Labs (PSL)
The PSL is a simulated black-box penetration testing environment for students in the Cybersecurity Professional Penetration Tester (CPPT) program at Divergence Academy. During this week-long training scenario, I served as the team led for a group of four students on team Delta, or Digital Environment Leveraging Tactical Analysis. Our team was able to gain access to 11/12 machines in the PSL environment and captured 17 total flags yielding 425 points out of a possible 540. 

During this simulated engagement, I learned and used the following applications and services: 

Burp Suite for automated web application fuzzing 

Ran screen sessions in my Kali Linux attacker box to establish continuity and organization of my work 

Utilized xargs (extended arguments) for automation and data manipulation

Ran John the Ripper and Hydra utilizing several password wordlists (rockyou.txt, 1000-most-common-passwords.txt, 10k-most-common.txt, and fasttrack.txt) and rule sets (JumboSingle and OneRuleToRuleThemAll) to brute-force retrieved hashed passwords from engagement 

SQLmap to automate SQL query injections and enumerate backend database

Revshells.com to create reverse shells for command injection and establishing persistence on the system

Linux Nano file creator to create scope files and store discovered usernames/passwords 

Network Mapper (Nmap) to conduct fast scans and service scans of each of the target IP addresses

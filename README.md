# Pentest Scenario Labs (PSL)
The PSL is a simulated black-box penetration testing environment for students in the Cybersecurity Professional Penetration Tester (CPPT) program at Divergence Academy. During this week-long training scenario, I served as the team led for a group of four students on team Delta, or Digital Environment Leveraging Tactical Analysis. Our team was able to gain access to 11/12 machines in the PSL environment and captured 17 total flags yielding 425 points out of a possible 540. 

During this simulated engagement, I learned and used the following applications and services: 
Burp Suite for automated web application fuzzing 
Ran screen sessions in my Kali Linux attacker box to establish continuity and organization of my work 
Utilized xargs (extended arguments) for automation and data manipulation
Hashcat, John the Ripper, Medusa, and Hydra (break down password crackers by function), 
SQLmap to automate SQL query injections and enumerate backend database, 
Revshells.com to create reverse shells for command injection and establishing persistence on the system, 
Linux Nano file creator to create scope files and store discovered usernames/passwords 





MSFconsole 
Searchsploit
Simple python server
- Downloaded exploit in /tmp to evade EDR detection (memory)
Establish persistence on a target to allow for pivoting
SSH connection (proxy chains)
Wordlists
- Rockyou
- 10k most common credentials
- Options with wordlists
